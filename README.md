A functional reactive Twitter API client in node.

## Install

```bash

```

## Use
The following shows how to use BaconAndEggs can be used to connect to a Twitter API stream.
In this example we connect to the statuses_filter stream and look for public tweets containing the string 'funny'.

```
creds =
  key: process.env.TWITTER_USER_KEY
  secret: process.env.TWITTER_USER_SECRET
  token:  process.env.TWITTER_USER_TOKEN
  tokenSecret:  process.env.TWITTER_USER_TOKEN_SECRET

request = BaconAndEggs.requestStatusesFilterStreaming { track: 'funny' }

stream = BaconAndEggs.toEventStream(creds, request)

stream.log()
```
## API
### toEventStream(creds, request)
Returns a [bacon.js](http://baconjs.github.io/) EventStream containing JSON responses from the Twitter API.
See the bacon.js [documentation](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/#common-methods-in-eventstreams-and-properties) for a list of methods that can be applied to a bacon.js EventStream.

``` creds ``` -
An object containing the keys 'key', 'secret', 'token', 'token_secret' with values being your API key, secret, token, and token secret.
If needed, API credentials can be obtained from the [twitter app manager](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).

``` request ``` -
A request object created from one of the request* methods below.

### request(method, resource, params)

## Examples
Examples are included in the examples folder.

The examples can be ran via the following (replace <example.coffee> with the name of the example to run).

```
gulp compile && coffee examples/<example.coffee> --n
```

The examples use a few environment variables to load the Twitter API credentials. i.e.
```
creds =
  key: process.env.TWITTER_USER_KEY
  secret: process.env.TWITTER_USER_SECRET
  token:  process.env.TWITTER_USER_TOKEN
  token_secret:  process.env.TWITTER_USER_TOKEN_SECRET
```

Prior to running the examples, either export your twitter key, secret, token, and token_secret via the command line OR
put a ``` .env ``` file at the root of the project with the values to be exported.

Example ``` .env ``` file:
```
TWITTER_USER_KEY=YOUR-USER-KEY-HERE
TWITTER_USER_SECRET=YOUR-USER-SECRET-HERE
TWITTER_USER_TOKEN=YOUR-USER-TOKEN-HERE
TWITTER_USER_TOKEN_SECRET=YOUR-USER-TOKEN-SECRET-HERE
```
